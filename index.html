          Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
          system, which fall under the command of the government at three
          levels: Central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian
          Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
          public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy
          initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education
          policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India’s
          constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976
          made education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central
          and state governments shared formal responsibility for funding and
          administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with
          28 states and eight union territories, this means that the potential
          for variations between states in the policies, plans, programs and
          initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
          policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of
          state-level programs and policies. State governments and local
          government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary
          schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is
          growing. Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private
          bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary
          education (Grades 1-8) were managed by government and 16.86% of
          schools were under private management (excluding children in
          unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education
          Guarantee Scheme and in alternative learning centers). Of those
          schools managed privately, one third are ‘aided’ and two thirds are
          ‘unaided’. Enrolment in Grades 1-8 is shared between government and
          privately managed schools in the ratio 73:27. However in rural areas
          this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower.

          In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81%
          for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission
          surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017-18, 84.7% for male and 70.3% for
          female.[8] This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%,
          53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%.[9] India's
          improved education system is often cited as one of the main
          contributors to its economic development.[10] Much of the progress,
          especially in higher education and scientific research, has been
          credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in higher
          education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a
          Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 26.3% in 2019,[11] there still remains
          a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment
          levels of developed nations,[12] a challenge that will be necessary to
          overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from
          India's comparatively young population. Poorly resourced public
          schools which suffer from high rates of teacher absenteeism may have
          encouraged the rapid growth of private (unaided) schooling in India,
          particularly in urban areas. Private schools divide into two types:
          recognised and unrecognised schools. Government ‘recognition’ is an
          official stamp of approval and for this a private school is required
          to fulfil a number of conditions, though hardly any private schools
          that get ‘recognition’ actually fulfil all the conditions of
          recognition. The emergence of large numbers of unrecognised primary
          schools suggests that schools and parents do not take government
          recognition as a stamp of quality.

          At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school
          system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students
          receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[14] Certain
          post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private
          education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but
          is projected to be a US$40 billion market.[15] As per the Annual
          Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural children
          between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth
          annual survey to report enrolment above 96%. India has maintained an
          average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this age group from
          year 2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of students in the age
          group 6-14 who are not enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the
          academic year 2018 (ASER 2018).[16] Another report from 2013 stated
          that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited
          urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an
          increase of 2.3 million students over 2002 total enrolment, and a 19%
          increase in girl's enrolment.[17] While quantitatively India is
          inching closer to universal education, the quality of its education
          has been questioned particularly in its government run school system.
          While more than 95 per cent of children attend primary school, just 40
          per cent of Indian adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9-12).
          Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2 billion to education
          in India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of
          around 25% of teachers every day.[18] States of India have introduced
          tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such
          schools.
